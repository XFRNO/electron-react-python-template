# In a real application, this file would contain the database session management.
# For example, using SQLAlchemy:
#
# from sqlalchemy import create_engine
# from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
# from src.core.config import settings
#
# engine = create_engine(settings.DATABASE_URL)
# SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

# For now, we'll just have a placeholder.
