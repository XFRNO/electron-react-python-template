# Project Overview

Welcome to the official documentation for the Electron React Python Template!

This project is a comprehensive monorepo template designed to kickstart development of modern desktop applications. It combines a powerful stack:

- **Electron**: For building cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies.
- **React**: For creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Python (FastAPI)**: For a high-performance backend server.
- **Turborepo**: For efficient monorepo management.
- **pnpm**: For fast and disk-space-efficient package management.

## Purpose

The goal of this template is to provide a solid foundation for building complex desktop applications without the hassle of setting up the initial project structure, build configurations, and inter-process communication. It's designed to be easily extensible and customizable to fit your specific needs.

## Key Features

- **Monorepo Structure**: All applications and packages are managed within a single repository, simplifying dependency management and code sharing.
- **Pre-configured Build System**: Comes with a ready-to-use build system for development and production.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: The Electron main process manages the Python backend, and the React frontend communicates with it via an API.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The project is structured to support growth, with clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and shared packages.
