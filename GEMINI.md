# Gemini Customization

This file helps customize Gemini's behavior for this project.

## General Guidelines

*   **Tech Stack**: This is a monorepo containing an Electron application with a React frontend and a Python backend.
*   **Package Manager**: We use `pnpm` for managing dependencies.
*   **Monorepo Management**: We use `turbo` to manage the monorepo.

## Available Commands

*   `pnpm dev`: Starts the development server for all apps.
*   `pnpm build`: Builds all apps.
*   `pnpm test`: Runs tests for all apps.
